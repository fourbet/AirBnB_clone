# AirBnb clone

## Description of the project:
This is a project of Holberton School and we had 7 days to do it. 
<br /><br />This is the first step towards building our first full web application: an AirBnB clone. It consists of **writing a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects**.
It specifies classes for **User, City, State, Amenity, Place** and **Review** that inherits from the **BaseModel** class.
<br /><br />
The **BaseModel** take care of the initialization of all the instances.
<br /><br />
Additionnaly, we have created the first abstracted storage engine of the project: the **FileStorage** class. Instances are **serialized** to a JSON file and are **deserialized** from a JSON file to instances.

## Description of the command interpreter:
To manage the objects of our project we are using a command interpreter that can:
<br />
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
